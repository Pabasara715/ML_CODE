Weather Prediction with SVM and Random Forest

This repository contains code and data for predicting weather conditions based on meteorological features in Sri Lanka. Weâ€™ll use the SVM and Random Forest algorithms to tackle this task.

Problem Definition
Task (T): Predicting the weather according to climate conditions.
Experience (E): Meteorological data and weather-related features of Sri Lanka.
Performance Measure (P): Accuracy, Multiclass log loss.

Handling Missing Data
Missing data will be handled by imputation or exclusion based on the number of missing values:
For numerical values, mean imputation will be used.
For categorical values, mode imputation will be applied.

Algorithms
  a. Algorithms
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Random Forest
  b. Availability in Libraries

Both algorithms are readily available in the scikit-learn library for Python
